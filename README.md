# IndiaGDPPrediction
Here we predict the Indian GDP StateWise using Simple MLP Neural Network and Time Series Analysis

The statistical data was taken from NITI Aayog

# Files

- XLSX : Raw Excel files downloaded from NITI Aayog website
- CSV : the corresponding CSV files for the above excel files
- PROCESSED : the files were read and converted to a Pandas Data frame and then saved here

- helper.py : the helper functions to create the above folder with processed files

- NITIDATA.csv : cleaned pre-processed files which has then been used for the GDP Model
- NITI_2020_DATA.csv : Time Series model was used to predict the 2020 feature values
